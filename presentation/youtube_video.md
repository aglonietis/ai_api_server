always be up to date with its status.
It also provides AI suggestions in the idea creation process.

opening the platform you can see latest ideas submitted
with the important details and there is an ability to view all ideas.

First lets create a ticket.

You have to login as a user and then see a button to create an idea.

Choose a category and enter details about the idea.

After entering description, the system uses AI to look for similar ideas.

This greately reduces the amount of duplicates.

After creating the idea you can view it in Ideas section after clicking on My Ideas

As you can see the issue lacks information and is in Triage stage. It needs to be reviewed by an admin.

So lets move to an idea with more details.

There are various fields and comment types.

As a customer we can add client feedback type comment

After any change to tickets, all users receive notification in top right corner.
You can see all the idea updates in the system and always be up to date.
They also link to the ideas.

ability to edit ideas.
